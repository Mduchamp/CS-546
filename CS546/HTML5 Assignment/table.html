			<th>This is a table.</th>
			<td>It has several columns.</td>
			<td colspan="2">Some cells can take up more than one column.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>It has rows too!</td>
			<td>I can have as many of either as it wants.</td>
			<td>The cells are just text boxes with certain properties.</td>
			<td>The table declaration takes care of the exact size and location.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td rowspan="2">Cells can also take up multiple rows.</td>
			<td>This is harder to deal with.</td>
			<td>Because tables are declared row-by-row, except where a cell takes multiple rows.</td>
			<td>Then, a cell on the next row is automatically declared.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>See? This is the second cell!</td>
			<td>This also happens with columns, but they are in the same row.</td>
			<td>And that's the basics of tables.</td>
